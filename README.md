# LLM-BookRecommender

Being my first machine-learning side project and through the aid of online resources, I developed and produced a simple yet intuitive semantic recommendation system that provides book recommendations for users based on a brief description of a book they would like to read (eg.- "A book for kids about nature"), the genre of the book, and the emotional tone of its writing (eg.- joyful, suspenseful, sad, etc.).

This system was developed using Large Language Models, specifically utilising Langchain and HuggingFace APIs. Coding was done using Python via Google Colab, and the UI was designed through Gradio.

The dataset utilised for developing the model was obtained from Kaggle.
